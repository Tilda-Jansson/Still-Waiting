## How to Play   
Use the WASD keys to move the DVD logo into a corner. You will need precision and good timing to do it since you can make one move every second.
The goal is to get as many corner hits as possible in as few moves as possible.

## Description
This DVD logo game, built with Defold, features a dynamically moving logo that bounces off screen edges, with sound effects for bounces and corner hits. It includes random initial positioning and direction, collision detection with edge tolerance, and HTML integration for displaying scores.

I wanted to familiarise myself with Lua so I made this game over the course of 1.5 days with this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ws0QtAiiXQ) as my source of inspiration. **Note that this game is a work in progress**
